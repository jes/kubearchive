This program takes archives of Kube radio and stores them in hour-long chunks.

Usage: ./kubearchive

The program will then write files of the form 2012/12/05/2000.mp3 each
containing "an hour" of recording of Kube radio.

If you want it to run reliably, make an init script and have it start on boot.

Bugs:
 - some of the chunks are several minutes longer than an hour; why?
 - this takes up a *heck* of a lot of disk space (about 1.2G/day)
